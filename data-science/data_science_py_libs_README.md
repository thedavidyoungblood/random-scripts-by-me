# Python Library Installation Script

## Overview
This script automates the process of checking for the presence of various Python libraries in the environment, installing them if they are not found, and handling any errors that occur during the installation process. The script is designed to work with a wide range of libraries, including those for machine learning, data visualization, natural language processing, big data, and database management.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip installed and configured
Internet connection for downloading packages
Appropriate permissions to install packages on the system

## Features
Library Checking: Verifies if a library is already installed to avoid redundancy.
Automated Installation: Installs missing libraries using pip.
Error Handling: Catches errors during installation and attempts to troubleshoot common issues.
Logging: Maintains an installation log for review.
System-level Installation Warning: For some libraries that require system-level installation or additional setup, the script logs a warning for manual action.
Usage
Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system.

Download the script to a local directory.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

## Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy code
python library_installation_script.py
Monitor the terminal for any output or instructions, especially for libraries that may require manual intervention.

## System-level Installation
For libraries that cannot be installed via pip alone, the script provides a warning message with instructions or a reference to the documentation. Follow these messages to complete the installation process for such libraries.

## Troubleshooting and Logs
If an installation fails, the script attempts to resolve common issues automatically. If these attempts fail, it logs detailed error information to library_installation.log. Review this log file for error messages and suggested actions.

## Manual Steps for Specific Libraries
Some libraries listed in the system_level_libraries dictionary within the script will require additional steps:

graphviz: Check the official Graphviz documentation for installation instructions.
torch-geometric: Requires PyTorch and additional dependencies. Refer to the library's installation guide.
dgl: May need additional setup if using alongside PyTorch or TensorFlow.
graph_nets: Installation instructions are provided by DeepMind for using with TensorFlow and Sonnet.
stanfordnlp: Additional setup for Stanford NLP models may be necessary.
pyspark: Requires Java and Spark to be installed on the system.

## Contributing
If you encounter a library that requires special handling, you can contribute to the script by adding the library and its resolution steps to the libraries_versions and system_level_libraries dictionaries.

## Support
For support, start by reviewing the log file. If the issue persists, consult the documentation for the respective library or raise an issue in the repository where the script is hosted.

## Instructions Document
The attached technical documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using the Python Library Installation Script. It includes an overview of the script's functionality, step-by-step usage instructions, and guidance on handling system-level installations and troubleshooting.

Users are encouraged to read the documentation thoroughly before running the script to understand its capabilities and requirements. The document also advises on how to contribute improvements and where to seek support.

Please ensure all prerequisites are met, and follow the manual steps for specific libraries where automatic installation is not possible. The log file will serve as the first point of reference for any issues that arise during the use of the script.
